# README

Welcome to the **NLP with PyTorch** workshop. This repo is divided into three main parts:

1. Slides (presentations)
2. Labs
3. Datasets
4. Students (projects)

As we progress through the workshop, you can expect that the content may be regularly updated. We will be mostly using Google Colab for the exercises. Discussion & updates will occur over Slack (you should have a link). 

Good luck & happy learning!
